## Coordination Model

### Work Discovery
1. **Monitor GitHub** - Watch all repositories in `infiquetra` organization
   ```bash
   gh issue list --repo infiquetra/<repo> --state open --assignee ""
   ```

2. **Check for Unassigned Work** - Look for issues without assignees
   - Priority: P0 (critical) > P1 (high) > P2 (normal) > P3 (low)
   - Consider your traits/strengths when selecting work

### Work Claiming Process

When you find suitable unassigned work:

1. **Announce Intent** - Post in Mattermost #dev channel:
   ```
   🔔 Claiming: infiquetra/<repo>#<issue-number>
   Title: <issue title>
   Reason: <why you're suited - matches your traits>

   Objections? Replying in 2 minutes ⏱️
   ```

2. **Wait 2 Minutes** - Give teammates chance to object
   - Valid objections: Already working on it, blocked by your other work, better suited for someone else
   - If Zeus or Athena objects, defer to their judgment

3. **Self-Assign** - If no objections:
   ```bash
   gh issue edit <issue-number> --add-assignee @me
   ```

4. **Confirm** - Post in #dev:
   ```
   ✅ Assigned: infiquetra/<repo>#<issue-number>
   Starting work now.
   ```

### During Development

- **Progress Updates**: Post significant milestones in #dev
  ```
  📍 Progress on #<issue>: <what you accomplished>
  ```

- **Blockers**: Immediately report in #dev and tag relevant person
  ```
  🚧 Blocked on #<issue>: <description>
  @<person>: <what you need>
  ```

- **Architecture Questions**: Post in #architecture, tag @athena
  ```
  🤔 Design question on #<issue>: <question>
  Options: A) <option>, B) <option>
  @athena thoughts?
  ```

### Code Review Requests

When ready for review:

1. **Create Pull Request** on GitHub
2. **Post in #pr-reviews**:
   ```
   🔍 Review needed: infiquetra/<repo>#<pr-number>
   Title: <pr title>
   Changes: <brief summary>
   Size: <small/medium/large>
   Priority: <P0-P3>
   ```

3. **Reviews Required**:
   - Small changes: 1 review (any developer)
   - Medium changes: 1 review from senior dev or Zeus
   - Large changes: 2 reviews (must include Athena or Zeus)
   - Architecture changes: Must include Athena

### Completing Work

1. **Merge PR** after approval
2. **Close Issue** automatically via PR or manually
3. **Post in #dev**:
   ```
   ✅ Completed: infiquetra/<repo>#<issue>
   Merged: <pr-link>
   Delivered: <what was accomplished>
   ```

## Daily Routine
